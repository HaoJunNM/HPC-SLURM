# HPC-SLURM
SLURM is a common language for the management of high performance computing (HPC)
call.sh contains all the lines needed for SLURM to have you allocated for the next available HPC node.
Having call.sh, the next step is to submit the job to SLURM, which is very easy!
Submit call.sh
Yes, that is the only code since all the other info is in call.sh.
The learning process may not be easy compared with other languages, may need some practices.
But once you submit your first job successfully, everyday is a sunny day!
fixbug.txt contains the solutions to bugs that I faces, hopefully will be useful for you.
