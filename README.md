# HPC-SLURM
SLURM is a common language for the management of high performance computing (HPC).<br/>
My operating system is Windows, so I installed Putty to connect to HPC. Mac and Linux are different.<br/>
call.sh contains all the lines needed for SLURM to have you allocated for the next available HPC node.<br/>
Having call.sh, the next step is to submit the job to SLURM, which is very easy!<br/>
Submit call.sh<br/>
Yes, that is the only code since all the other info is in call.sh.<br/>
The learning process may not be easy compared with other languages, may need some practices.<br/>
But once you submit your first job successfully, everyday is a sunny day!<br/>
fixbug.txt contains the solutions to bugs that I faces, hopefully will be useful for you.
